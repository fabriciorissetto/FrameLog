FrameLogCustom
==============

A custom log framework forked from https://bitbucket.org/MartinEden/framelog/. 

This is a customization of the original FrameLog from Martin Eden, where I don't include null values on delete and I create a new column called Old Value where the information about the change is stored, this way the search is eased.

For more information about the original Framework visit https://bitbucket.org/MartinEden/framelog/wiki/Home.

> Note: This repository is not currently updated with the latest version of Framelog, I recommend using the original version for better community support.
